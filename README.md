# Typing
10fastfingers kind of a typing test prototype in SFML

There is extra functionality in classes, I did not remove those just in case you might wanna have words separately like a word hunting game.

There is no timer, just typing.

Example data provided in bin/Release/data

Whole code is in main.cpp, RichText class is from https://github.com/skyrpex/RichText
